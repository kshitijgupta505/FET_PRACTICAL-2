To create a webpage related to music store.
Objective: To create a webpage related to music store.
A music store page is a perfect experiment for music lovers. To build this page, you must know
the nitty-gritty of HTML5 and CSS3.

Exercise:
On the music page, the first thing to do is to add an appropriate background image and write a
short description of what you will find on this page. The header section of the page will contain
different menus that list songs based on features like genre, year, singer, album, and so on.
Add relevant links and images for the collection of songs available. At the footer, you can
include contact details, and links for registration, in-store purchases, subscription packages, and
trial options.
